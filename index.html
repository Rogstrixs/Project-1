            <h2>Origin and Evolution:</h2>
            <p>Anime finds its roots in early 20th-century Japan, influenced by traditional Japanese art forms and Western animation techniques. Osamu Tezuka, often regarded as the "God of Manga," played a significant role in shaping modern anime with works like "Astro Boy" in the 1960s. Since then, anime has evolved dramatically in terms of animation quality, storytelling complexity, and thematic depth.</p>
